# CD Template Generator - Final Deployment Guide

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for deploying your CD Template Generator application to Vercel, including how to handle the current build issues.

## Current Build Issues

There are syntax errors in the `src/lib/pdf-generator.ts` file that need to be fixed before deployment. The main issues are:

1. Type errors in the React PDF renderer components
2. Syntax errors in the component structure

## Pre-Deployment Steps

### 1. Fix the PDF Generator File

The most critical issue is in `src/lib/pdf-generator.ts`. You need to fix the syntax errors in the CDTemplate component:

```typescript
// Look for this section around line 260-270
const CDTemplate = ({
  frenteAfuera,
  frenteDentro,
  disco,
  traseraAfueraLeft,
  traseraAfueraRight,
  traseraDentroLeft,
  traseraDentroRight,
  measurements = defaultMeasurements,
}: Partial<CDTemplateProps>) => {
  // Change from arrow function with parentheses to arrow function with curly braces
  return (
    <View style={styles.cdSection}>
      {/* Front Covers Section (FRENTE_AFUERA and FRENTE_DENTRO) */}
      <Text style={styles.sectionTitle}>Front Cover Section</Text>
      {/* Rest of your component */}
    </View>
  );
};
```

### 2. Fix Middleware Type Issues

If you're encountering type errors in the middleware.ts file:

1. Install the missing type definitions:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @types/node
   ```

2. Or modify the middleware.ts file to avoid using process.env directly.

### 3. Temporary Build Configuration

If you need to deploy quickly without fixing all issues, update your `next.config.js`:

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  // ... other config
  typescript: {
    ignoreBuildErrors: true,
  },
  eslint: {
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
  },
};
```

## Deployment Process

### Prerequisites

1. Create a [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup) if you don't have one
2. Create a Vercel Blob store for image storage:
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Navigate to Storage → Create a new Blob store
   - Copy the provided `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`

### Option 1: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Push your code to a GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repository
2. Go to the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
3. Click "New Project" or "Add New..." → "Project"
4. Import your repository
5. Configure environment variables:
   - Add `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` with your token value
6. Under "Build & Development Settings":
   - If you're still having build issues, set the "Override" for the build command to:
     ```
     next build --no-lint
     ```
7. Click "Deploy"
8. After deployment, add `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` with your new deployment URL in the project settings

### Option 2: Deploy via Vercel CLI

1. Install Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Login to Vercel:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. Deploy your project:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

4. During the interactive setup:
   - Enter your environment variables when prompted
   - Confirm deployment settings

5. After deployment, update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` in your project settings

## Post-Deployment

After deploying, verify that all features work correctly:

- Image uploads and cropping
- PDF generation
- Form submissions
- Mobile responsiveness

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. Build Failures

If your build fails on Vercel:

- Check the build logs for specific errors
- Try deploying with the `--no-lint` flag
- Consider using the "Override" build command in Vercel settings

### 2. Image Upload Issues

If image uploads fail:

- Verify your `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is correct
- Check that your Vercel Blob store is properly configured
- Look for CORS errors in the browser console

### 3. PDF Generation Problems

If PDF generation doesn't work:

- Check browser console for React PDF renderer errors
- Verify that all required components are imported correctly
- Test with simpler PDF templates first

### 4. Environment Variable Issues

If environment variables aren't working:

- Make sure they're properly set in Vercel project settings
- Verify that variables are being accessed correctly in your code
- Remember that client-side variables must be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`

## Long-term Maintenance

Once deployed, you should:

1. Fix all TypeScript and syntax errors in your local development environment
2. Re-enable type checking and linting for future builds
3. Set up proper error handling and logging
4. Consider adding monitoring and analytics
